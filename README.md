# Data Normalization and Entity-Relationship Diagramming

An assignment to normalize the structure of data and establish a set of Entity-Relationship Diagrams for the data.

## 1. A table containing the original dataset

I added an additional three fields including Course Name, Student Major, and Professor Department.

| assignment_id | student_id | due_date | professor | assignment_topic                | classroom | grade | relevant_reading    | professor_email   | course_name                 | student_major       | professor_department |

## 2. Description of what makes this data set not compliant with 4NF

1. There could be transitive dependencies such as professor and professor_email, suggesting that professor_email is dependent on professor rather than on the primary key (assignment_id or student_id). The same could apply to course_name and classroom, where classroom might depend on course_name rather than the primary keys.

2. The dataset has multivalued dependencies which are not aligned with 4NF. For example,

- a 'professor' can be assigned to multiple 'course_name' and potentially multiple 'classroom' as well.
- a 'course_name' can have multiple 'assignment_topic'

3. Solution: In order to convert the table into 4NF, we need to decompose the table into smaller tables that eliminate these multivalued dependencies and reduce the redundancy in previous NF.

## 3. Tables containing the 4NF-compliant version of the data set

Each table represent only first few samples of data.
